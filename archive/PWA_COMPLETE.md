### From Kivy Desktop → PWA Web
- **UI Framework**: Kivy → HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Platform**: Desktop → Web (works on iOS/Android/Desktop)
- **Distribution**: Standalone .exe → Web URL
- **Installation**: Direct download → Add to Home Screen
- **Updates**: Manual updates → Instant web updates

### Benefits of PWA Approach
- **No App Store**: Direct distribution via URL
- **Cross-Platform**: One codebase works everywhere
- **Instant Updates**: No user downloads required
- **Easy Development**: No macOS needed for iOS deployment
- **Lower Barriers**: Users just visit URL, no installation friction

## 🔍 Investigation Section Handling

Your enhanced Investigation parsing works perfectly:

```python
# Handles all these variations:
**Investigations:** 
**Investigations**:
**Investigation:** 
**Investigation**:
**Investigations:  ** (with trailing spaces)
```

The PWA maintains full compatibility with your 1,435+ Investigation sections.
