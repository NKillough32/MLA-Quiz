Anatomy SVG Attribution

The anatomy SVGs referenced or used by this project were sourced from Wikimedia Commons. Below are the original file pages and suggested attribution. Please check each file page for the exact license terms and attribution requirements (some images are public domain, others are Creative Commons â€” CC-BY or CC-BY-SA).

Bones (frontal):
- Human skeleton front (English): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_skeleton_front_en.svg

Bones (posterior/back):
- Human skeleton back (UK variant): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_skeleton_back_uk.svg

Muscles (front & back):
- Muscles front and back: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Muscles_front_and_back.svg

Notes:
- These files are used under their respective Wikimedia licenses. If you redistribute the SVG files in this repository, ensure you include the appropriate attribution as required by the license (e.g., author name, source URL, license).
- If you prefer local copies rather than runtime fetching from Wikimedia, I can download sanitized copies into `static/anatomy/` and include full attribution in this file.

How the app uses them:
- The application will attempt to load local files under `/static/anatomy/` first (e.g., `bones_front.svg`). If a local file is not present, it will fall back to fetching the Wikimedia-hosted SVG at runtime.

If you'd like me to embed local copies and add the full license text and author credits, say "Download and save local copies" and I'll attempt to fetch and sanitize them and add them to the repo along with full attribution text.
